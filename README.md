Note: This site was originally intended to work on browsers as old as Internet Explorer 6 but I quickly realized that's nearly impossible due to limited JS and CSS issues. Then, I decided I'd target early 2010s browsers like Chrome 12, Firefox 4, and Internet Explorer 11, while making sure that this extra compatibility doesn't affect the experience on modern browsers. I still wanted it to work on Windows XP though, so I'm now attempting to make this site work on IE8 and up, which is going fairly well so far and most features are supported!
